<h1>Lawyers select - or, as lawyers say, designate - testimony to draw the court's attention to the passages in the testimony that the lawyers urge supports their client's position.  When testimony is transcribed into print, every line on a page is numbered.  And when testimony is submitted to the judge, the lawyers have to direct the judge to each line and page.  </h1>
