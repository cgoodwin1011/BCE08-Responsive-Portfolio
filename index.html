                        <p class="bio_text">My name is Charles Goodwin.  I am a lawyer and I am a programmer.  And I am the founding principal of Armigeri LLC.  Armgeri - Latin for esquire - is an information technologies and services firm focusing on the legal market and allied fields.  Armigeri seeks to deliver the highest quality software and web products that allow users to focus on their work, rather than wrestle with technology.  We provide both commercial and custom software.  Our first-to-market product is <i>Designate</i>, software for designating transcribed testimony. <i>Designate</i> automates a wretched task that lawyers hate.  (See &ldquo;Designations&rdquo; Sidebar)</p>
                        <p class="bio_text">I'd rather talk about work than myself, but this is where you're supposed to put a biography, so I'm going to put a biography here.</p>
                        <p class="bio_text">I was born. I went to lots of school. I programmed some.  I went to more school.  I practiced law for a long time, until I got tired of it.  Then, I turned to technology because I like gadgets and I like computers.  And I like working on problems that can increase productivity and maybe even make a better world.</p>

                <p class="aside_text">For everyone who is not a lawyer:</p>
                <p class="aside_text">Lawyers select &ndash; or, as lawyers say, &ldquo;designate&rdquo; &ndash; testimony to draw the court's attention to the passages in the testimony that supports their client's position (or at least so the lawyers urge).  When testimony is transcribed into print, every line on a page is numbered.  And when testimony is submitted to the judge, the lawyers have to direct the judge to each line and page.  </p>

                </object>
                <p class="aside_text">Lawyers thus spend hours highlighting printed or electronic xtranscripts.  The lawyer - or more likely, his staff - takes the marked transcript and prepares a list of the page and line numbers.
